        <h2>I am a senior at the University of Denver. I am studying Computerscience with a minor in mathematics and history. When I am not in school, I serve as the Program Coordinator for A rural student development program inside the FIRST@DU office. I also work at the Apple Store in Cherry Creek where I get to meet tons of interesting people. Outside of my love for reading, I also love movies music, and am an avid hiker, fisherman, golfer, and camper. Because it is very important, my favorite color is teal! If I could spend one day anywhere in the world, I would do it in Iceland: ALONE! My favorite movie is <i> The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</i> and if you spend enough time hanging out with me you with learn that I constantly quote it. Wow, Thanks for Reading, now you know literaly everything about my entire life. Good Job. Kinda nosy though!</h2>
