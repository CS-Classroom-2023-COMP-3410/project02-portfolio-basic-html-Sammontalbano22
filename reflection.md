During this assignment I found it a fun and creative challenge to use exclusively original html. I have some decent experience using html js and css previously so having to think of things creatively in order to achieve the style I wanted without using css was fun. The hardest part of this project was remembering from systems how to sftp my files from my local to our du linux server. But eventually I got it.
